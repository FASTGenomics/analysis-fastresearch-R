It is a great way to help the reader of your notebook  to understand what you are doing. **Our advise: use as much markup as possible!** It will make your results more reproducible and your interpretations better understandable. Everything you saw until here in this notebook is written in markdown. If you are already in interactive mode, double-click this text to change it.\n",
